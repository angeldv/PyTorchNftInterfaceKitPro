# PyTorchNftInterfaceKitPro

## Description

A smart contract suite implementing fractionalized NFT ownership with on-chain governance via quadratic voting and a novel ERC-721 wrapper that dynamically adjusts rarity traits based on community consensus.

## Features

- Integrate a custom PyTorch model deployment pipeline directly into the NFT minting process.
- Implement asynchronous image pre-processing using CUDA for accelerated NFT generation.
- Enable dynamic NFT metadata updates via on-chain smart contract interactions.
- Provide a customizable training loop for PyTorch models based on NFT rarity distributions.
- Expose a gRPC interface for remote model inference and NFT attribute generation.
- Utilize federated learning techniques to train PyTorch models on decentralized NFT datasets.
- Support on-device model execution using PyTorch Mobile for augmented reality NFT experiences.
